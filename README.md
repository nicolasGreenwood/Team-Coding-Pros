# Team Coding Pros
Welcome, members and visitors! This is the main website for our new coding club, Team Coding Pros.

First of all, you guys should know that this site version, as of now, is not, and I repeat, is NOT the final design of my first release of the site. I just built this in a day, to get the repo up and running on GitHub, and to open a space to brainstorm design and features with the team.  So don't judge me on the awful design. I promise, when I release the official design, you'll like it â€” at least a little bit.

But that'll take a while. It has some 3D features, so it'll take nightmarishly long. So just forget this moment and the fact that you even visited this website. Forget it all, so that when I release it, you won't remember how long ago I made this repo and know how long it for me to actually make a mediocre website.

Umm, what else to say? Oh, if you're a Team Coding Pros member, maybe you could bookmakr this...? That way you could check it every now and then, to see any updates.

That's all. Despite the terrible design, good stuf is in the works. I promise. This is just for demo purposes.

Thanks for popping by and taking a look!

Nicolas, co-leader of Team Coding Pros
